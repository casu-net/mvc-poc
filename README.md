# PoC - MVC on the frontend

## Introduction

The main goal of this project is to illustrate the MVC pattern flow implemented in
a basic cart web application.

The picture below should give us an idea of the general
flow:

Note: we are not including the interactions with the services, which are called by the
models. They provide helpers and handlers which are used globally. We'll deep into it later.
